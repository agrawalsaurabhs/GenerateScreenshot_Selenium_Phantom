# GenerateScreenshot_Selenium_Phantom
A console application to generate screenshot of any web page using selenium and phantomjs.

Instead of opening a chrome browser, i am using phantomjs(a headless browser) to open the web page and take screenshot. 

In future, would like to make this as an api for generating screenshot, where a request can be made to generate screenshot of a given page
in a given dimension.
Currently works only for anonymous websites.

Need to check how to make it work with authenticated sites.
